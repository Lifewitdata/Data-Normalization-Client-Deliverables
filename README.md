# Data Normalization & Client Deliverables 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates the role of a **Data Management Analyst** by processing and normalizing messy datasets received from multiple third-party sources.  
The goal is to transform heterogeneous data into **client-ready deliverables** with proper formatting, quality control, and documentation.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Load and integrate data from three disparate sources (CSV).  
- Standardize key fields: `OrderID`, `CustomerName`, `OrderDate`, `AmountUSD`, `Email`.  
- Perform data normalization (date formats, casing, whitespace, invalid values).  
- Implement **quality control checks** (missing values, invalid emails, numeric errors).  
- Deliver a **cleaned, normalized dataset** along with client-ready documentation.
